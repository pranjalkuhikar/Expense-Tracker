# Expense Tracker

🔍 "We can't afford the pay rise he wants."

HR Manager: "Then we should pay for it."

Boss: "What?! Why?"

HR Manager: "If we can't afford his increase, we can't afford to advertise, interview, hire, pay, and train his replacement. It costs less to keep staff than replace them."

💡 The conversation above is a powerful reminder of the value of investing in your current team. In today's competitive job market, retaining top talent is more cost-effective and beneficial in the long run.

🚀 On a related note, I recently took my skills to the next level by creating an expense tracker using React JS. 🌟

Here's what I added:
✅ Filter Functionality:Easily categorize expenses to see where your money is going.
✅ Add Expense Feature: Quickly log new expenses to keep your tracking up-to-date.

Learning and building this project taught me invaluable lessons about efficiency and functionality, much like the conversation between the boss and the HR manager. Let's continue to invest in the right areas—whether it's talent or skills—to drive long-term success!
